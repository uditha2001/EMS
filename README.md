# Exam Management System (EMS): Streamlining Exam Workflows 🎓

Empowering the Computer Science Department with an efficient, centralized solution to manage examination-related workflows seamlessly.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Exam Management System (EMS) is a robust platform designed to streamline the exam-related operations of the Computer Science Department. It automates critical processes such as exam scheduling, paper creation, marking, moderation, and progress tracking, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives
### For the Computer Science Department 🏛️

- 📅 **Exam Scheduling**: Automate and manage exam timetables efficiently.
- 📝 **Paper Creation & Moderation**: Facilitate secure question paper creation, review, and moderation workflows.
- 🔒 **Encrypted Paper Storage**: Ensure security by encrypting question papers.
- ✅ **Marking & Evaluation**: Streamline the grading process with structured evaluation tools.
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Monitor exam-related activities and track overall progress effectively.

## 🔍 The Problem We Solve
The department faces challenges in managing various examination activities manually, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. EMS solves these problems by:

- **Automating exam workflows**, reducing manual workload.
